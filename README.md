# OmniPOP

Simplifying POP sales, manufacturing, and delivery processes.

This repository contains a minimal skeleton for the OmniPOP application.

- **backend** – Express server exposing an API.
- **frontend** – React-based client served as static files.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
cd ..
```

### Run the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

The backend listens on port 5000 by default.

### Run the Frontend

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The frontend is served on port 3000 and will display a greeting.
